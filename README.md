It's a bot that does things on Twitter and Discord for PewDiePie

## Twitter
Currently, the bot ([@pewds_bot](https://twitter.com/pewds_bot)) will automatically reply to tweets from @pewdiepie, @tseries, @grandayy, @dolandark, @MrBeastYT, and more with the current subgap info. It will also automatically tweet out when the subgap drops below 25k.

## Discord

This Discord bot can provide you real-time information regarding the sub gap.
You can invite it [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=546361604107927562&scope=bot&permissions=70679617).

For the latest list of commands, run `p!help`.

## Reddit
Currently, the bot can be found on reddit as u/pewds_bot and can be summoned by commenting p!gap anywhere. Please note that it's reading comments from EVERYWHERE on reddit, so it might not catch your reply the first time.
